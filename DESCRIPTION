Description: Hybrid Mortality Modelling (HMM) provides a framework in which mortality around "the accident hump" and at very old ages can be modelled under a single model. The graphics' codes necessary for visualization of the models' output are included here. Specifically, the graphics are based on the assumption that, the mortality rates can be expressed as a function of the area under the curve between the crude mortality rates plots and the tangential transform of the force of mortality.
